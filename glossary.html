        <div class="card">
            <h4>Angular Size and Distance</h4>
            <p>The apparent size of an object in the sky, or the distance between 
                two objects, measured as an angle. Your index finger held at arm’s 
                length spans about 1°, your fist about 10°.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Aperture</h4>
            <p>The diameter of a telescope’s main lens or mirror — and the scope’s 
                most important attribute. As a rule of thumb, a telescope’s maximum 
                useful magnification is 50 times its aperture in inches (or twice its 
                aperture in millimeters). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Asterism</h4>
            <p>Any prominent star pattern that isn’t a whole constellation, such as the 
                Northern Cross or the Big Dipper. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Asteroid (Minor Planet)</h4>
            <p>A solid body orbiting the Sun that consists of metal and rock. Most are 
                only a few miles in diameter and are found between the orbits of Mars 
                and Jupiter, too small and far away to be seen easily in a small telescope.
                A few venture closer to the Sun and cross Earth’s orbit. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Astronomical Unit</h4>
            <p>The average distance from Earth to the Sun, slightly less than 93 million 
                miles (150 million kilometers). </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section B-->
        <p id="B">B</p>
        <div class="card" id="blackmoon">
            <h4>Black Moon</h4>
            <p>A term used to describe an extra new that occurs in a season. It 
			usually refers to the third new moon in a season with four new moons. 
			The term is sometimes used to describe a second new moon in a single 
			month.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Black Hole</h4>
            <p>A concentration of mass so dense that nothing — not even light — can escape 
                its gravitational pull once swallowed up. Many galaxies (including ours) 
                have supermassive black holes at their centers. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Blue Moon</h4>
            <p>Traditionally, something that happens rarely or never. More recently, this 
                has come to mean the second full Moon in a single calendar month. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section C-->
        <p id="C">C</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Comet</h4>
            <p>A comet is a “dirty snowball” of ice and rocky debris, typically a few miles 
                across, that orbits the Sun in a long ellipse. When close to the Sun, the 
                warmth evaporates the ice in the nucleus to form a coma (cloud of gas) and 
                a tail. Named for their discoverers, comets sometimes make return visits 
                after as little as a few years or as long as tens of thousands of years. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Compound Telescope</h4>
            <p>A telescope with a mirror in the back and a lens in the front. The most 
                popular designs are the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (SCT) and the 
                Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope (commonly called a “Mak”). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Conjunction</h4>
            <p>When the Moon or a planet appears especially close either to another planet 
                or to a bright star. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Constellation</h4>
            <p>A distinctive pattern of stars used informally to organize a part of the sky. 
                There are 88 official constellations, which technically define sections of 
                the sky rather than collections of specific stars. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section D-->
        <p id="D">D</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Declination (Dec.) </h4>
            <p>The celestial equivalent of latitude, denoting how far (in degrees) an object 
                in the sky lies north or south of the celestial equator. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Double Star (Binary Star) </h4>
            <p>Two stars that lie very close to, and are often orbiting, each other. 
                Line-of-sight doubles are a consequence of perspective and aren’t physically 
                related. Many stars are multiples (doubles, triples, or more) gravitationally 
                bound together. Usually such stars orbit so closely that they appear as a 
                single point of light even when viewed through professional telescopes. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section E-->
        <p id="E">E</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Earthshine</h4>
            <p>Sunlight reflected by Earth that makes the otherwise dark part of the Moon 
                glow faintly. It’s especially obvious during the Moon’s thin crescent phases. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Eclipse</h4>
            <p>An event that occurs when the shadow of a planet or moon falls upon a second 
                body. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon’s shadow falls upon Earth, which 
                we see as the Moon blocking the Sun. When Earth’s shadow falls upon the Moon, 
                it causes a lunar eclipse. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Ecliptic</h4>
            <p>The path among the stars traced by the Sun throughout the year. The Moon and 
                planets never stray far from the ecliptic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Elongation</h4>
            <p>The angular distance the Moon or a planet is from the Sun. The inner planets 
                of Mercury and Venus are best seen when at maximum elongation, and thus are 
                highest above the horizon before sunrise or after sunset. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Ephemeris</h4>
            <p>A timetable with celestial coordinates that indicates where a planet, comet, 
                or other body moving in relation to background stars will be in the sky. Its 
                plural is ephemerides (pronounced eff-uh-MEHR-ih-deez). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Equinox</h4>
            <p>The two times each year, near March 20th and September 22nd, when the Sun is 
                directly overhead at noon as seen from Earth’s equator. On an equinox date, 
                day and night are of equal length. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section F-->
        <p id="F">F</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Field of View</h4>
            <p>The circle of sky that you see when you look through a telescope or binoculars. 
                Generally, the lower the magnification, the wider the field of view. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Focal Length</h4>
            <p>The distance (usually expressed in millimeters) from a mirror or lens to the 
                image that it forms. In most telescopes the focal length is roughly equal to 
                the length of the tube. Some telescopes use extra lenses and/or mirrors to 
                create a long effective focal length in a short tube. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Focal Ratio (f/number) </h4>
            <p>A lens or mirror’s focal length divided by its aperture. For instance, a 
                telescope with an 80-mm-wide lens and a 400-mm focal length has a focal 
                ratio of f/5. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section G-->
        <p id="G">G</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Galaxy</h4>
            <p>A vast collection of stars, gas, and dust, typically 10,000 to 100,000 
                light-years in diameter and containing billions of stars (from galaxias 
                kuklos, Greek for “circle of milk,” originally used to describe our own 
                Milky Way). Galaxies may be spiral (with one or more spiral-shape arms), 
                elliptical (shaped more like fuzzy footballs with no distinguishing features), 
                or irregular (chaotic appearance). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Gibbous</h4>
            <p>When the Moon or other body appears more than half, but not fully, illuminated 
                (from gibbus, Latin for “hump”). </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section H-->
        <p id="H">H</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Histogram</h4>
            <p>A plot of the number of pixels in an image at each brightness level. It’s 
                a useful tool for determining the optimum exposure time; the histogram of 
                a properly exposed image generally peaks near the middle of the available 
                brightness range and falls to zero before reaching either end. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section I-->
        <p id="I">I</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Inclination</h4>
            <p>The angle between the plane of an orbit and a reference plane. For example, 
                NASA satellites typically have orbits inclined 28° to Earth’s equator.</p>
        </div>

        <p id="L">L</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Libration</h4>
            <p>A slight tipping and tilting of the Moon from week to week that brings 
                various features along the limb into better view. The main causes are 
                two aspects of the Moon’s orbit: its elliptical shape and inclination 
                to the ecliptic. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Light Pollution</h4>
            <p>A glow in the night sky or around your observing site caused by 
                artificial light. It greatly reduces how many stars you can see. 
                Special light-pollution filters can be used with your telescope to 
                improve the visibility of celestial objects. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Light-year</h4>
            <p>The distance that light (moving at about 186,000 miles per second) travels 
                in one year, or about 6 trillion miles. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Limb</h4>
            <p>The edge of a celestial object’s visible disk. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section M-->
        <p id="M">M</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Magnification (power) </h4>
            <p>The amount that a telescope enlarges its subject. It’s equal to the 
                telescope’s focal length divided by the eyepiece’s focal length. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Magnitude</h4>
            <p>A number denoting the brightness of a star or other celestial object. 
                The higher the magnitude, the fainter the object. For example, a 
                1st-magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a 6th-magnitude star. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Meridian</h4>
            <p>The imaginary north-south line that passes directly overhead (through 
                the zenith). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Messier object</h4>
            <p>An entry in a catalog of 103 star clusters, nebulas, and galaxies 
                compiled by French comet hunter Charles Messier (mess-YAY) between 
                1758 and 1782. The modern-day Messier catalog contains 109 objects. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Meteor</h4>
            <p>A brief streak of light caused by a small piece of solid matter entering 
                Earth’s atmosphere at tremendous speed (typically 20 to 40 miles per 
                second). Also called a “shooting star.” If material survives the trip 
                through the atmosphere, it’s called a meteorite after landing on Earth’s 
                surface. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Meteor Shower</h4>
            <p>An increase in meteor activity at certain times of the year due to Earth 
                passing through a stream of particles along a comet’s orbit around the 
                Sun. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Milky Way</h4>
            <p>A broad, faintly glowing band stretching across the night sky, composed 
                of billions of stars in our galaxy too faint to be seen individually. 
                It’s invisible when the sky is lit up by artificial light or bright 
                moonlight. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Mount</h4>
            <p>The device that supports your telescope, allows it to point to different 
                parts of the sky, and lets you track objects as Earth rotates. A sturdy, 
                vibration-free mount is every bit as important as the telescope’s optics. 
                A mount’s top, or head, can be either alt-azimuth (turning side to side, 
                up and down) or equatorial (turning parallel to the celestial coordinate 
                system). “Go To” mounts contain computers that can find and track celestial 
                objects automatically once the mounts have been aligned properly. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section N-->
        <p id="N">N</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Nebula</h4>
            <p>Latin for “cloud.” Bright nebulas are great clouds of glowing gas, lit up 
                by stars inside or nearby. Dark nebulas are not lit up and are visible only
                because they block the light of stars behind them. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Section O-->
        <p id="O">O</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>A telescope’s main light-gathering lens or mirror. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Occultation</h4>
            <p>When the Moon or a planet passes directly in front of a more distant planet
                or star. A grazing occultation occurs if the background body is never 
                completely hidden from the observer. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Opposition</h4>
            <p>When a planet or asteroid is opposite the Sun in the sky. At such times 
                the object is visible all night — rising at sunset and setting at sunrise. 
            </p>

        <!--Section P-->
        <p id="P">P</p>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>Parallax</h4>
            <p>The apparent offset of a foreground object against the background when 
                your perspective changes. At a given instant, the Moon appears among 
                different stars for observers at widely separated locations on Earth. 
                Astronomers directly calculate the distance to a nearby star by measuring 
                its incredibly small positional changes (its parallax) as Earth orbits the 
                Sun. </p>

            <h4>Retrograde</h4>
            <p>When an object moves in the reverse sense of “normal” motion. For example, 
                most bodies in the solar system revolve around the Sun and rotate 
                counterclockwise as seen from above (north of) Earth’s orbit; those that 
                orbit or spin clockwise have retrograde motion. This term also describes 
                the period when a planet or asteroid appears to backtrack in the sky because 
                of the changing viewing perspective caused by Earth’s orbital motion. </p>

            <h4>Solstice</h4>
            <p>The two times each year, around June 20th and December 21st, when the Sun is 
                farthest north or south in the sky. At the summer solstice, the day is longest 
                and the night is shortest, and vice versa at the winter solstice. </p>

            <h4>Star</h4>
            <p>A massive ball of gas that generates prodigious amounts of energy (including 
                light) from nuclear fusion in its hot, dense core. The Sun is a star. </p>

            <h4>Star Cluster</h4>
            <p>A collection of stars orbiting a common center of mass. Open clusters typically 
                contain a few hundred stars and may be only 100 million years old or even less. 
                Globular clusters may contain up to a million stars, and most are at least 10 
                billion years old (almost as old as the universe itself). </p>

            <h4>Sunspot</h4>
            <p>A temporary dark blemish on the surface of the Sun that is a planet-size region 
                of gas cooler than its surroundings. Sunspots can be viewed safely using a solar 
                filter. </p>

            <p>The line on the Moon or a planet that divides the bright, sunlit part from the 
                part in shadow. It’s usually the most exciting and detailed region of the Moon 
                to view through a telescope. </p>

            <h4>Transit</h4>
            <p>When Mercury or Venus crosses the disk of the Sun, making the planet visible as 
                a black dot in silhouette, or when a moon passes across the face of its parent 
                planet. Transit also refers to the instant when a celestial object crosses the 
                meridian and thus is highest in the sky. </p>
